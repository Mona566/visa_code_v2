Cover Letter
Dear Visa Officer,
Purpose of Travel
I am writing to apply for an Irish Long Stay(D) Study Visa. My name is Wang Zhicheng
(former name: Wang Qingcheng), and I have been accepted by Swan Training Institute in
Ireland to pursue a 25-week English language programme. This programme is an essential
part of my long-term academic plan, as it will help me significantly improve my academic
English skills and prepare for future higher education opportunities.
Studying in Ireland will enable me to learn in a native English environment, enhance my
cross-cultural communication abilities, and build a strong foundation for my future academic
development. I have already completed the tuition payment required to secure my place in the
programme.
Financial Support
I confirm that I have paid RMB 45,271 in tuition fees to Swan Training Institute, as
instructed by the school. The payment receipt and school confirmation letter are enclosed.
My father has stable incomes and sufficient financial capacity to cover all costs during my
stay in Ireland, including living expenses, accommodation, insurance, and any additional
study-related expenses. Supporting financial documents- including bank statements, income
certificates, employment certificate, and a sponsorship declaration- are included in this
application.
Ties to China and Commitment to Return
I maintain strong family, social, and long-term career ties in China. My father and extended
family all reside in China, and I remain closely connected with them. After completing my
studies in Ireland, I intend to return to China to continue my academic pathway and develop
my future career.
Studying in Ireland is a temporary but important step that will allow me to strengthen my
qualifications before returning to China to pursue my long-term goals.
Conclusion
Thank you very much for taking the time to review my application. I sincerely hope for a
positive outcome. The opportunity to study at Swan Training Institute will greatly improve
my English proficiency, enhance my academic competitiveness, and support my future
development upon returning to China.
Yours faithfully,
Wang Zhicheng
